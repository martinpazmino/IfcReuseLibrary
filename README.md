# 🏗️ IFC-Based Reusable Component Library

## 📌 Project Summary

This open-source platform enables architects, planners, and designers to **upload IFC models** and automatically extract, catalog, and search **reusable building components** (like doors, windows, beams, etc.). The goal is to support **sustainable construction** through digital reuse and circularity.

The system processes IFC files, identifies components marked for reuse, stores them with metadata, and presents them through an intuitive web interface. Users can filter and export the components for integration in their design projects.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Promote circular construction by digitizing reusable materials.
- Provide an easy-to-use web platform for exploring reusable components.
- Support architects with early design integration of reused elements.
- Lay the foundation for IFC-based AI by structuring component data.
